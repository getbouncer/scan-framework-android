# Overview
**This repository has moved! Please see the new codebase at https://github.com/getbouncer/cardscan-android**

This repository contains the framework needed to quickly and accurately scan items (payment cards, IDs, etc.). [CardScan](https://cardscan.io/) is a relatively small library (1.9 MB) that provides fast and accurate payment card scanning.

Note this library does not contain any user interfaces or ML models. Other libraries [Scan Payment](https://github.com/getbouncer/scan-payment-android) and [Scan UI](https://github.com/getbouncer/scan-ui-android) build upon this and add ML models and simple user interfaces. 

Scan Framework serves as the foundation for CardScan and CardVerify enterprise libraries, which validate the authenticity of payment cards as they are scanned.
